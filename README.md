# Perfect README Generator

## Description

I created a README generator so users can easily create perfect and professional READMEs. After spending time and energy creating an application, users can simply answer nine questions and have a README ready for deployment. The generator automatically formats the page, creates license badges, creates a link to the user's GitHub account and links the table of contents. 

## Usage

Below is a video demonstrating the application:
